<h1> Hello Everyone ! Welcome to my Demo Website </h1>
<p> This is an open source contribution demo project which I have made using "React" . This project includes single page static website .</p>
<p> Starting point of this website is from inex.html</p>
<p> Then we see main.jsx which is starting point of javasript codes in react disguise</p>
<p> Further we have started with our components calling - Header , Mainbody , Introreso , TeamMembers and  Footer</p>
<p> I hace all the components in the src folder itself and then in the components folder .</p>
<p> For each component ,there is a folder in component folder</p>
<p> And within that folder , we have all the .jsx files with their .module.css files.</p>
Note:- For users using this demo website in mobile , are requested to zoom out while website gets loaded. Its mobile phase is under debugging mode ....
